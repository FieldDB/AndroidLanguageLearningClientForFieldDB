      Field linguists and open source developers have gotten together to create a
      speech recognizer for low resource language speakers. You can use this
      application to prepare your Android to guess your speech. You need to read some
      suggestions and then contact WiFi in order to prepare your voice model. We
      expect that after reading some training sentences you will have a better result.
      Because low resource languages are different from other languages ​​so we do
      not know how useful this application will be. You can try it, it is mostly
      experimental and used for research, so we can not guarantee that it will be
      useful. If you use the app to train your recognizer, you agree that we can
      use the anonymous training recordings to improve the recognizer and for linguistics research.
      Here's our resulting research: http://batumi.github.io
