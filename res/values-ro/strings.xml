    <string name="app_explanation">Field linguists and open source developers have gotten together to create  a speech recognizer for low resource language speakers. You can use this application to prepare your Android to guess your speech. You need to read some suggestions and then contact WiFi in order to prepare your sound model. We expect that after reading some training sentences we will have a better result. Because the low resource languages are different from other languages ​​so we do not know how much this application will be useful. You can try it, it is more experimental and used for research, so we can not guarantee that it will be useful.
